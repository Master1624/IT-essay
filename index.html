                    Nowadays the society is living in a digital era, where everything is instantly
                    but also is trying to make people lives better than they even imagine. Software's
                    like CCTV management, data analytics' software and so on are some examples that
                    we can mention in this document.<br><br>
                    But one thing is for sure, there are a lot of software that are failing because of
                    one little thing, they are not having in mind the correct design principles in modern
                    architecture when designing a software. 
                </p>
            </section>

                    One of the most important things that companies must take into a count are the 10 
                    design principles of modern architecture that are:
                    <ul id="principles">
                        <li>Security</li>
                        <li>Agility</li>
                        <li>Scalability</li>
                        <li>Availability</li>
                        <li>Modularity</li>
                        <li>Uncoupled</li>
                        <li>Real Time</li>
                        <li>Simplicity</li>
                        <li>Reusability</li>
                        <li>Independency</li>
                    </ul>
                    But most of the times these principles are not immersed in the software developed, making
                    companies lose their business impact in the society. <br><br>

                    In some cases, simplicity is not taken into a count in software because of the multiple
                    information usage that the business requires, making it fragile when the developer is going 
                    to keep maintaining it. When the developer wants to keep things simple, it is more likely to 
                    have multiple calls of one same interface, requiring different kind of information from it 
                    and sending it back to the front, so the user really do not see that redundancy. In this case,
                    the developer is applying not just the simplicity principle, but also the reusability principle,
                    using one same interface for different purposes. <br><br>

                    It is also common to watch architectures failing in the availability principle, making the 
                    information not accessible to the user. One of the most recent examples was Donald Trump's 
                    app, which was number 1 in downloads of Apple Store, but when users entered their information,
                    they received the corresponding email with the successful message, but they were not able to 
                    enter to the app. The information they used was saved, but the availability to enter to the
                    app and making use of it was not possible, making it a total failure to nowadays software. <br><br>

                    There is not always problems with the design principles, there are software where might have
                    the correct usage of each principle, but making it useless. The software is to help people
                    make things that might be easy, but most of the times there are modules in the software that do not
                    offer any functionality to it, making it clumsy. Developers might have in mind that clumsy 
                    functionalities are the ones that do not contribute companies in terms of making things easier, and 
                    in the end of the day, they are not useful to companies. <br><br>

                    One of the first things developers must understand well are the definition of each principle 
                    of modern architecture design. Trying to make things easier, doesn't mean that the software might miss principles or 
                    common-sense usability that help the software be solid in terms of contributing to society. <br><br>

                    Deeper studies of these principles help companies succeed in the market, but also in the future
                    that software might be sustainable in other fields that the market requires. <br><br>

                    Having an environment where the code could be evaluated, measured and regulated is a great practice.
                    In some cases, platforms such as SonarQube is useful to make this happen, helping the developers to detect
                    bugs, code simplicity, automatic reviews to evaluate if it is done in the right way. But not just that,
                    helping developers in different programming languages. <br><br>

                    Most of the times, developers evaluate their software when they already have the database configured, but
                    that leaves them blooding and their system. The database must be evaluated in terms of the software that
                    is going to be developed, not backwards. The databases have different usability's depending on the software, that's
                    why developers should be careful when doing this. <br><br>

                    Tools are also helpful when people is going to develop something, and in this case is not the exception. Developers
                    must have into a count that making usage of different tools that automate procceses, integrating different systems and
                    so on, help them to maintain better their software. Architecture is not just applying things for today's problems,
                    is also having in mind that what we are developing would help people in the future to grow their businesses, making their 
                    lives better that they are right now.

                    As a developer, one of the most challenging things I got is to use in the right way these principles, trying to
                    understand them better, looking for tools that would help me hosting or automating the software for me, but also 
                    looking how they are developed, and once I have understand it, apply it in my future projects, or checking the
                    actual projects I have made during the last years and applying them. <br><br>

                    Also, I will help other partners which have the same problems mentioned above, recommending step by step what do they
                    have to do to make their software simplier and also making it scalable to the future, not in terms of functionality,
                    but also in terms of the technologies used in them. This last thing is one of the most common I have been watching in the 
                    market, making companies lose client because of outdated programming languages. <br><br>

                    I would thank professor Alejandro for teaching me things that are useful in my professional career, most of my knowledge
                    is because of my work experience, and for the record, most of my university knowledge hasn't help me enough for what I am 
                    doing today.
